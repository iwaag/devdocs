# In-System Agents

## cagent (pj-clusterintent)

- Responds to requests for explaining/observing/changing desired state and/or actual state of the cluster.
- In-System workflow shold be designed so that cagent receive a report when cagent's explanation of the cluster found invalid.
- That report path exists since `devdocs/episodes/better_communication/zulip_cagent_receive`:
  a DM to the **Cagent bot** in Zulip, or `POST /window` on cagent's
  unauthenticated window, records the report as a local file and does not try
  to repair it in that turn. Ask the window "what has been reported lately"
  to read them back.
- Three doors today — node (mTLS), human (bearer token), window
  (unauthenticated). The window is where they are heading; see the
  cross-project `devdocs/todo_done.md` entry.

## autolab agent(pj-agdev/agautolab)

- Responds to request for explaining/observing/developing projects.
- Its entrance is the Zulip channel named after its instance — questions
  only, nothing is started there. Development work goes in a `workplan-…`
  topic in the project's own `pj-<slug>` channel, because the channel is what
  says which project the work is for. Its own introduction in `#agents` is the
  authority on both (`agent_standardize` p4).

## agfront(pj-agdev/agfront)

- Responds to any requests from Human and sends messages to other agents.
- It can also be asked to **supervise**: stay with a request until the agent
  doing the work finishes, answering what it asks along the way. Since
  `agent_standardize` p5 a front run may last an hour for that reason, and
  waiting happens inside the run — a run that ends is a supervision that
  stopped.

## forge agent(pj-agdev/agforge)

- Responds to requests for providing media assets with characteristics specified in the requests.
- Its entrance is the Zulip channel named after its instance; an asset
  request is an `assetplan-…` topic there (`agent_standardize` p1).

## How an agent is found

Each agent posts its own introduction to the shared `#agents` channel, under
an append-only `intro-<instance>` topic. **That post is the contract**: it is
where another agent learns the entrance, the topic prefix and what is safe to
do — so routing vocabulary travels as posted content and is never compiled
into a consumer's guide. Re-post after a behavior change; a stale
introduction is acted on as if it were current.

An introduction is also where an agent says what it needs *from* the
requester. autolab's says a task is not closed until the requester agrees it
is done — a contract that lived only in its code until p5, where a supervisor
had no way to learn its own part in it.

# Adopted Policies for Development of In-System Agents

## Favorable

Easier Next Time
Single Entrance
Tool Giving
Evidence-Driven Guidance
Failure Farming

## Unfavorable

Anxiety-Driven Guidance
Tool Implantation
Unexplained Chainsaw

## Agent ≠ Model
- The backend model/harness is a swappable parameter of an agent, never its identity.
- Every agentic run records which backend served it. See devpolicy/agent_records.md for the common record.

# Other policies

## Deus Ex Machina note
- When the Omni Agent performs work that belongs to an in-system agent, leave a one-line note in the episode doc: "did X for agent Y — handoff candidate".
- Perhaps positive for the mission, perhaps negative for workflow growth; the note is the whole obligation.

# Ansible Commands

Run from `pj-clusterintent/ansible_agdev`:

- **Update autolab nodes**:
  ```bash
  uv run --project ../nctl nctl render production --out inventories/generated
  ansible-playbook -i inventories/generated/production.yml playbooks/agent/setup_autolab_node.yml --limit agautolab1
  ```
